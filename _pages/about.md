Hi! I am Keyu, a senior undergraduate student double majoring in **Computer Science** and **Applied & Computational Mathematics** at the University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.usc.edu/)), with a minor in **Artificial Intelligence Applications**.

Passionate about Natural Language Processing (NLP), I’m fascinated by its potential to bridge communication gaps and foster understanding. At USC, I am currently working on cutting-edge NLP research under Professors [Xiang Ren](https://www.seanre.com/) and [Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/), under the mentorship of [Brihi Joshi](https://brihijoshi.github.io/). My work focuses on **explainability, cultural inclusivity, and building user trust** in AI systems.

### Academic Achievements & Honors
- **USC Center for Undergraduate Research in Viterbi Engineering (CURVE) fellow**.
- **USC Dornsife Dean’s List**: Every semester since Fall 2021.
- **USC Viterbi Dean's List**: Every semester since Spring 2022.
- **Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society Member**.

### Current Research
- **Explainable NLP Systems**: Collaborating on projects to align model-generated explanations with audience needs, emphasizing readability and cultural inclusivity.
- **Trust in Visual Language Models (VLMs)**: Designing metrics to evaluate explanation trustworthiness, especially for users with limited access to visual contexts.

### Beyond Research
As a Course Producer and grader for multiple computer science and math courses, I’ve mentored peers and fostered inclusive learning environments. 

Outside academics, I’ve led teams in competitions like the **Kaggle LLM-Prompt-Recovery Challenge**, earning a top-3.4% ranking globally.
